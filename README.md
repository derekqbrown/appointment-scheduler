# software-2 Appointment Scheduler (using a database)
These files are for the WGU C195 course assessment

This project allows the user to schedule appointments which are stored in and retrieved from a database (which must be set up separately - files to set up the database are included). 

This project builds on the ideas used in the project for Software 1, and implements database functionality with SQL commands. 

See the "c195-assessment-instructions" file for more details.
