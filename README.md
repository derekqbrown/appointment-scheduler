These files are for the WGU C195 course assessment

This project allows the user to schedule appointments which are stored in and retrieved from a database (which must be set up separately - files to set up the database are included). 

This project builds on the ideas used in the project for Software 1 (https://github.com/derekqbrown/software-1), and implements database functionality with SQL commands. 

See the "c195-assessment-instructions" file for more details.
